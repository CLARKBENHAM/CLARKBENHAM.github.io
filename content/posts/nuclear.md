the US probably never had the ability to do a unilateral first strike:
1. B-29 doesn't have the range. First true intercontinental bomber is the B-36, with 22 planes delivered in Feb 1949, ~100 by EOY.
2. Jet MiG-15 make propeller-driven B-36 obsolete. MiG-15 first production plane flew Dec 31 1948, start full manufacture in march 1949, and 729 total are built in 1949. (And USSR can only build MiG-15 because UK sells engine blueprints. 'Stalin is said to have replied, "What fool will sell us his secrets?". To Stalin's amazement, the British Labour government and its Minister of Trade, Sir Stafford Cripps, were perfectly willing to provide technical information and a license to manufacture the Rolls-Royce Nene.')

2b. Soviets test first atomic bomb in Aug 1949.
3. So US possibly could've nuked USSR in Early-Mid 1949 without retaliation, though balance of B-36s vs MiG-15 unclear.
4. But the US doesn't have enough bombs to cripple USSR. Only ~50 in June 1948, 170 in June 1949, and 300 in 1950. TROJAN plan in dec 48 called for 130, OFFTACKLE in Dec 49 called for 292. But Harmon's May 1949 committee reported  "even if all precisely hit their targets, the USSR would not surrender, its leadership would not be seriously weakened, and its military could still operate".

So actually atomic bombs with propeller driven bomber planes still favor a defensive posture:
1. They likely could've been shoot down by jet fighters
2. They require a large preparation time which prevents surprise attacks. "The Central Intelligence Agency believed that it could warn of a surprise Soviet attack days or even weeks ahead of time because of the necessary preparation time"
3. They require massive investments in bomber fleet to deliver: "up to 30 days would be needed to deliver all Soviet weapons. "

This changes with Hydrogen Bombs and Jet Bombers.
1. The US jet bomber B-52 is operational in 1955.
2. But USSR air defense SA-1 was tested against 20 simultaneous targets in 1954 around Moscow. SA-2 shoots down U-2 in may 1960.
3. Total US Stockpile 2400 in 1955. Ivy Mike on Nov 1 1952 but first combat weapon is EC-17 with 5 built from mar-oct 1954 and Mark-17 with 200 built from Jul 1954 - Nov 1955.
4. Total Russian Stockpile is 5 in 1950 and 200 in 1955. First weapon-ready 1.6MT hydrogen bomb is RDS-37 tested Nov 1955, but 400kt bomb tested in aug 1953.

So ability of US first strike depends on quality of USSR command and control system or their ability to respond? Or do they not have enough rocket interceptors anyway?

LeMay wanted a single all out blitz where "his more than one thousand bomber crews as of 1954 could deliver 750 bombs in a few hours, while the USSR might need one month to deliver its 150 bombs."
And "In a 1956 speech to the National War College, LeMay said that if SAC was ordered to use its full nuclear arsenal against the USSR, "Between sunset tonight and sunrise tomorrow morning the Soviet Union would likely cease to be a major military power or even a major nation", while the USSR could not yet do the same to the US but was building the necessary arsenal" Is he just talking or were there credible reports he's right here? What specific data is there to backup what he's talking about?

But there's a difference in crippling them with first strike and a deterrence level 2nd strike, which US thinks is "assured second-strike capability to kill more than the twenty million Soviet citizens who had died in World War II"

But by 1961 the US also has 1k figher bombers armed with H-bombs within range of China and USSR. " SAC planners had regarded these tactical theater forces as so vulnerable, unreliable, and insignificant a factor in all-out nuclear war that they had not even bothered to include them in calculating the outcome of attacks in a general war.
In 1961 there were about seventeen hundred SAC bombers, including over six hundred B-52s and a thousand B-47s. In the bomb bays of the SAC planes were thermonuclear bombs much larger than those I had seen in Okinawa. Many were from five to twenty-five megatons in yield."
This is when world can be destroyed.


And then ICBMs change logic even further:
Soviet test in Aug 26 1957
American test Nov 1958
US thought "twenty to forty Soviet ICBMs ominously enhanced the possibilities of a disarming surprise attack. And thirty ICBMs were the lowest near-term estimate for Soviet missiles in the more recent RAND studies. The estimates by the Air Force and CIA of near-term Soviet ICBM forces looked toward several hundred, perhaps as early as 1959 (with a crash effort), almost certainly by 1960–61, with thousands in the sixties."
Soviets only have 2 in

US Nuclear powered submarine sea trials start in Jan 1955, Soviet military has them deployed 1958. First US nuclear armed ballistic missile submarines patrolled Nov 1960-Jan 1961. First Soviet nuclear missile armed nuclear powered sub with 3 missiles was in Nov 1960, first with 16 missiles entered service in 1967 when US has 41 deployed. 70% of modern nuclear warheads in the USA are carried by ballistic missile submarines. So is this when 2nd strike abilities are sufficient that no one will ever try anything?

Bombers can be recalled for hours, but US Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) needed decisions in less than 15 min.


#Going through these numbers make it obvious it's the MIRV and our failure to arms control that that has made proliferation much less stable. Also threats of nuclear armed torpedos. While "Golden Dome" may prove effective enough.




Also since USSR could never launch amphibious invasion of UK (In 1970s "one naval infantry brigade (2,100 men and 30 tanks); airborne support could be rendered … and merchant shipping is available for administrative landing of up to four divisions after seizure of a port", and to do this they'd have to decimate RAF and Navy anyway).
So while Russians could invade Continental Europe there's the last line of defense. And both sides think they're growing stronger in 1950s. Not as much fear of an invasion on both sides. So it takes 10 years for worldwide deaths to be possible and for the sides to really hate each other and belief in their own strength? How does this change perception of AI for geopolitics?
