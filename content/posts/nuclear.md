the US probably never had the ability to do a unilateral first strike:
1. B-29 doesn't have the range. First true intercontinental bomber is the B-36, with 22 planes delivered in Feb 1949, ~100 by EOY.
2. Jet MiG-15 make propeller-driven B-36 obsolete. MiG-15 first production plane flew Dec 31 1948, start full manufacture in march 1949, and 729 total are built in 1949. (And USSR can only build MiG-15 because UK sells engine blueprints. 'Stalin is said to have replied, "What fool will sell us his secrets?". To Stalin's amazement, the British Labour government and its Minister of Trade, Sir Stafford Cripps, were perfectly willing to provide technical information and a license to manufacture the Rolls-Royce Nene.')

2b. Soviets test first atomic bomb in Aug 1949.
3. So US possibly could've nuked USSR in Early-Mid 1949 without retaliation, though balance of B-36s vs MiG-15 unclear.
4. But the US doesn't have enough bombs to cripple USSR. Only 7-13 in Nov 47, ~50 in June 1948, 170 in June 1949, 300 by June 30 1950, 400 by Jan 1 1951, 1k in early 1953.
	TROJAN plan in dec 48 called for 130 (causing 6 million deaths), OFFTACKLE in Dec 49 called for 292. But Harmon's May 1949 committee reported  "even if all precisely hit their targets, the USSR would not surrender, its leadership would not be seriously weakened, and its military could still operate".

So actually atomic bombs with propeller driven bomber planes still favor a defensive posture:
1. They likely could've been shoot down by jet fighters
2. They require a large preparation time which prevents surprise attacks. "The Central Intelligence Agency believed that it could warn of a surprise Soviet attack days or even weeks ahead of time because of the necessary preparation time"
3. They require massive investments in bomber fleet to deliver: "up to 30 days would be needed to deliver all Soviet weapons. "

This changes with Hydrogen Bombs and Jet Bombers.
1. The US jet bomber B-52 is operational in 1955.
2. But USSR air defense SA-1 was tested against 20 simultaneous targets in 1954 around Moscow. SA-2 shoots down U-2 in may 1960.
3. Total US Stockpile 2400 in 1955. Ivy Mike on Nov 1 1952 but first combat weapon is EC-17 with 5 built from mar-oct 1954 and Mark-17 with 200 built from Jul 1954 - Nov 1955.
4. Total Russian Stockpile is 5 in 1950 and 200 in 1955. First weapon-ready 1.6MT hydrogen bomb is RDS-37 tested Nov 1955, but 400kt bomb tested in aug 1953.

Projected Soviet Deaths go from 13m to 150million when switch is made to Hydrogen bombs since same targeting plan is kept, just bigger bombs used:
	 "a few million deaths, then ten million, then up to thirteen million or so by 1955. But from that year to the next, 1956, there was a sudden tenfold jump in the estimates—an order-of-magnitude increase, as RAND analysts would put it—to a hundred and fifty million Soviet dead. By 1961, as I had already learned, the JCS forecast was for more than two hundred million in the Soviet bloc alone. "
	Goes from deterrance (and why soviets don't run over Europe after WW2: 'The news [of Hiroshima] had an acutely depressing effect on everybody. It was clearly realized that this was a New Fact in the world’s power politics, that the bomb constituted a threat to Russia, and some Russian pessimists I talked to that day dismally remarked that Russia’s desperately hard victory over Germany was now “as good as wasted.”'), to striking their military capabilities, to stoping them from striking the US.

So ability of US first strike depends on quality of USSR command and control system or their ability to respond? Or do they not have enough rocket interceptors anyway?



LeMay wanted a single all out blitz where "his more than one thousand bomber crews as of 1954 could deliver 750 bombs in a few hours, while the USSR might need one month to deliver its 150 bombs."
And "In a 1956 speech to the National War College, LeMay said that if SAC was ordered to use its full nuclear arsenal against the USSR, "Between sunset tonight and sunrise tomorrow morning the Soviet Union would likely cease to be a major military power or even a major nation", while the USSR could not yet do the same to the US but was building the necessary arsenal" Is he just talking or were there credible reports he's right here? What specific data is there to backup what he's talking about?

But there's a difference in crippling them with first strike and a deterrence level 2nd strike, which US thinks is "assured second-strike capability to kill more than the twenty million Soviet citizens who had died in World War II"


But by 1961 the US also has 1k figher bombers armed with H-bombs within range of China and USSR. " SAC planners had regarded these tactical theater forces as so vulnerable, unreliable, and insignificant a factor in all-out nuclear war that they had not even bothered to include them in calculating the outcome of attacks in a general war.
In 1961 there were about seventeen hundred SAC bombers, including over six hundred B-52s and a thousand B-47s. In the bomb bays of the SAC planes were thermonuclear bombs much larger than those I had seen in Okinawa. Many were from five to twenty-five megatons in yield."
This is when world can be destroyed.


And then ICBMs change logic even further:
Soviet test in Aug 26 1957
American test Nov 1958
US thought "twenty to forty Soviet ICBMs ominously enhanced the possibilities of a disarming surprise attack. And thirty ICBMs were the lowest near-term estimate for Soviet missiles in the more recent RAND studies. The estimates by the Air Force and CIA of near-term Soviet ICBM forces looked toward several hundred, perhaps as early as 1959 (with a crash effort), almost certainly by 1960–61, with thousands in the sixties."
	and "silo-based ICBMs (of which the Soviets had none in 1961, but were expected shortly to have hundreds to thousands)"
Soviets actually only have 2 in

Soviets need 300 ICBMs for complete first strike abilities: "The key projection was when the Soviets would or might have 300 or more. That was generally agreed to be the number that would allow coverage by missiles alone of all SAC bases in the United States and abroad as well as our soft ICBM sites".
	But laters theres's "Aside from our theater forces, they would also be hit by Polaris missiles and carrier forces at sea, and surviving Atlas and Titan missiles.", so in Oct 1962 50-100 still way too low for soviets.
So this is the missle gap after which point all previous investment can be taken out in first strike. The arms race accelerates again but now there's no benifit and is stable again? "The last year in which U.S. retaliation to a Soviet first strike would depend entirely on “soft” air bases and missile sites, subject to destruction by two hundred to three hundred Soviet ICBMs, was 1962. After that, thousands of Soviet ICBMs would be needed for high assurance of destroying in a first strike the large number of hardened ICBM silos the United States was programming (aside from U.S. submarine-launched Polaris missiles). In other words, 1962 was the last" year

Sept 1961 when we have photographs of only 4 ICBMs locations, and the empty lots where we suspected others.
But in 1960 people had suspected there wouldn't be a missile gap.
 "It was true that the lowest estimate, aside from the purportedly aberrant one by the Army and Navy, showed no significant gap—fifty Soviet ICBMs to our forty—but the majority opinion in the intelligence community was estimating a missile gap in favor of the Soviets as late as the June 7 NIE, a few days after the Vienna summit"

Soviet First Strike could've happened in "The 1959–62 period was their only opportunity to have such a disarming capability with missiles, either for blackmail purposes or an actual attack. After that, we were programmed to have increasing numbers of Atlas and Minuteman missiles in hard silos and Polaris sub-launched missiles."
	but they chose not to build up their ICBM arsenal. And didn't even have theres below ground.
USSR built many medium and intermediate range missles, could totally crater West Germany, but not harm the US.
So never was a deterrence gap either.
	"that buildup, which did begin in 1963–64 (particularly after Khrushchev was replaced by Brezhnev), could never promise the Soviets the strategic advantages it might have offered in 1958–62."


" in days when it was assumed by our military that either side could “accept” tens of millions of deaths, though not hundreds of millions."


US Nuclear powered submarine sea trials start in Jan 1955, Soviet military has them deployed 1958. First US nuclear armed ballistic missile submarines patrolled Nov 1960-Jan 1961. First Soviet nuclear missile armed nuclear powered sub with 3 missiles was in Nov 1960, first with 16 missiles entered service in 1967 when US has 41 deployed. 70% of modern nuclear warheads in the USA are carried by ballistic missile submarines. So is this when 2nd strike abilities are sufficient that no one will ever try anything?

Bombers can be recalled for hours, but US Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) needed decisions in less than 15 min. (Though see relative risks)


#Going through these numbers make it obvious it's the MIRV and our failure to arms control that that has made proliferation much less stable. Also threats of nuclear armed torpedos. While "Golden Dome" may prove effective enough.




Also since USSR could never launch amphibious invasion of UK (In 1970s "one naval infantry brigade (2,100 men and 30 tanks); airborne support could be rendered … and merchant shipping is available for administrative landing of up to four divisions after seizure of a port", and to do this they'd have to decimate RAF and Navy anyway).
So while Russians could invade Continental Europe there's the last line of defense. And both sides think they're growing stronger in 1950s. Not as much fear of an invasion on both sides. So it takes 10 years for worldwide deaths to be possible and for the sides to really hate each other and belief in their own strength? How does this change perception of AI for geopolitics?




The Doomsday Machine Risk of Nuclear Attacks:
(Though since bombers never practiced taking off with real bombs aboard, and never practiced going to rendezvous area and waiting for further confirmation, and national communication radio links are consistently spotty in this time period, and they'd have to have a separate communication plane sent up from another base, and if there was an accidental partial detonation on base then the planes in sky would assume it was a real attack, so these all combine to say there's a real risk of just going anyway. And Admiral Felt leader of CINPAC said he might launch anyway)
So while missiles can be launched in minutes theres a much lower risk of accidental launched by undisciplined troops during crises and that either makes it safer or allows for even higher levels of saber rattling by political leaders- they trust their troops won't make mistakes.
Also allows 2nd strike so don't need to get bombers in air where accidents can happen.

"delegation had extended as well to the tactical forces under theater command. After all, without delegation to CINCPAC, carriers and bases all over the Pacific might be precluded from launching retaliatory strikes just by atmospheric conditions that prevented an Execute message from getting through from the Pentagon to Hawaii,"
"he regarded, or he wanted us to know that he was supposed to regard, Admiral Felt’s delegation of nuclear authority to him as a more sensitive matter than Eisenhower’s delegation to Felt "
"Kivette believed that a limited war would remain centralized only so long as political maneuvering predominated, with no shooting"
"delegations would have looked questionable or even gravely illegal to the recipients if they had not shared a secret belief that the president himself had chosen to make such a delegation to theater commanders. But given that belief—and I found it widely held in the Pacific—it was clear that the same incentives that influenced the president existed for further delegations by lower commanders."
Include rest of excertps from Doomsday Machine about how easy to start false war.



But plans are quite difficult: "The major challenge lower-level planners faced was that many of these targets were co-located: that is, two targets to be hit by two different planes were close enough that the blast from one could knock the second plane out of the air, or, at a much greater distance, blind its pilots."
(In part because of this difficulty plus a lack of understanding of China: "there was no provision at all for attacking only the Russian targets in their sphere. In every plan for war with the Soviet Union, Chinese targets (including every major city in China) were also struck")
"The complexity of the calculations involved in this (illusory) effort meant that the planners couldn’t make many alternate plans. It took them all year to produce the single yearly-updated plan,"  and this is bound to be wrong because wind will affect planes from different directions differently and they didn't leave enough gaps for variance.
Also they can only strike all or nothing, since their tables only list coordinates, not what country that coordinate is in.

Drills variable in launching from their base got info: "reports from launch drills all over the Pacific and saw that the difference in times, for different bases, was often hours between sending the Execute order and the actual launches on the various bases, in a plan in which seconds mattered for planes to miss nearby explosions."
Bases don't even get centralized info quickly: "the reports of command post exercises—lists of when drill orders went out and when the bases actually received these orders during the exercises—I saw that the actual time when the various bases received their orders often varied by one, two, or as much as four hours. Some bases never received the orders. There were always problems in atmospheric disturbances"


Polaris missiles are great for deterrence: impossible to stop or sink subs, but because those missiles have small warheads and before GPS are inaccurate they're only good for targeting cities not first strike capabilities against soviet silos. So if US wants "massive retaliation" Navy gets boost but if its "counterforce" than massive bombers or smaller land missiles against soviet silos then there's the advantage".
Navy to 2nd strike cities and deter, if Soviet command and control good enough; Air Force to bomb before takeoff. This also changes how much they want to invest in making their missiles more accurate.
LeMay wanted 10k minutemen land based ICBMs, in part since not accurate enough.
Also Polaris is the first time you have a Nuke it'd even be worthwhile to keep in reserve: only targets cities so worth keeping as delayed threat.

Stragegy of shift to flexible response:
From single strike to massive deterance to counterforce to being able to iterate forward along war or back away from brink once started.
But Ellesberg wants to be ablt to deter, prevent, and avoid war since clearly counterforce won't work.
Also is it counterforce as in we've blown up their silos or is it counterforce in that we've only targeted military installations and so have threat of destroying their cities next so gotta keep cities in reserve.
	But in the first case you want to blow up command and control centers so they can't send out more commands and are disrupted, in the 2nd need USSR to keep a firm grip. Can't kill their command center to paralyze them from sending out more bombs, and save their command center so they don't order more bombs out.
		But soviet doomsday machine: ICBMs beep "Go" code to silos as they fly over, wasn't disclosed to the US. And the idea of fighting war by decapitation strike doesn't work why authority is further delegated.
"We would have to announce that intention long before hostilities began. Right away, this would be a marked departure from a policy of indicating beforehand and then carrying out our intent to destroy cities in all circumstances, a policy that removed any restraint on the enemy from targeting our own cities. Second, it required maintaining protected and controlled U.S. reserve forces under virtually all circumstances, thus preserving a threat capability in order to terminate the war. That might also deter enemy preparations to destroy our cities as an inevitable and automatic wartime strategy. Third, it called for preserving on both sides a command and control system capable of both controlling reserve forces and terminating operations. We would need a survivable command system capable of more than a simple “Go” decision; and we could not afford to deprive the Soviets62 of the same capability."
"This combination of damage-limiting and war-terminating goals implied that there were some choices to be made by the highest surviving U.S. authority even after general war hostilities had begun."

Real advantage is that if president has options during the war he'll want to be kept informed before it, if there's only a Go-No Go choice then he won't look into it.
	" a second, more important, advantage in demanding that a highest civilian authority be able to choose among options even in the midst of war. It provided a rationale—a “need to know”—for the president to inform himself and his civilian advisors before the war of the detailed nature of the proposed war planning."
Also They'll start adding locks to weapons since president will now be expected to have enough control during wartime and won't delegate authority.

"the major purpose of U.S. strategic weapons since the early fifties: to deter, with confidence, Soviet second-use retaliation to U.S. first use of tactical weapons against Soviet forces or their allies, by threatening that if the Soviets made a nuclear response in kind with its own tactical weapons SAC might escalate to a full first strike against the Soviet Union."
That's why you have so many to destroy the world, when you could destroy the nation with 20: 20 stops them from launching nukes it doesn't stop them from attacking you. By being able to destory world you've added another step on escalation ladder and the fear of getting to the last one lets them let you go 1 higher right before it.

# So political command structure was at riskiest from 1955ish to 1965ish? That's when few safegaurds, low level commanders had authority, only options were kill 400million people or not.
"General War" was "defined as Armed conflict with the Soviet Union" so any shooting immediatly bubbles over.
Technically/Hardware limits: Before 1950 you'd only have bombings with at most 4x tonnage of nazi in ww2 and many could be stopped by fighters.
By 1955 you have bomberforce that can likely get there (though look into air defences) with Hydrogen Bombs.
By 1960 it's kill everyone. The 1961 Plan in terms of Sino-Soviet deaths has 275 million would die in the first few hours of our attacks and 325 million would be dead within six months. 100Million Die in Easter Europe as planes bomb submarine pens and radar installations for passing further into USSR. 100M Allied Europeans could also die from fallout.
If US Strikes first and execute their planned missions. So they expect that Air Defenses won't work (but actually they might? Plan calls for bombing Radar Installations as fly inland.)
600M civillians dead from US first strike from blast and fallout, not from firestorms which could double that total. And firestorms could loft millions of tons into upper atmosphere which cause Nuclear Winter
Even in best case 100M more Europeans will die from Soviet Response, and at time CIA estimated 100 ICBMs could be launched at US.
And this was basically only plan, not that there'd be an early strike which focused on military.
